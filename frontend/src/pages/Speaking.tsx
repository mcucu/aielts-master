    sampleAnswer: "I'd like to talk about learning to play the guitar, which took me quite a long time to master. I started learning when I was about 15 years old after being inspired by a live concert I attended with my friends. The musician on stage made it look so effortless, and the way he connected with the audience through music was incredible.\n\nI wanted to learn the guitar because I've always loved music, and I thought it would be a great way to express myself. Additionally, I was quite shy as a teenager, and I believed that having a skill like playing an instrument might help me become more confident.\n\nLearning the guitar was much harder than I expected. At first, my fingers would hurt after practicing for just a few minutes, and I struggled to switch between chords smoothly. I practiced almost every day, starting with simple songs and gradually moving to more complex pieces. It took about two years before I felt comfortable playing in front of others.\n\nWhen I finally mastered enough skills to play complete songs fluently, I felt an immense sense of accomplishment. I remember the first time I played a song from start to finish without any mistakes â€“ it was such a rewarding moment. Now, I enjoy playing for friends and family at gatherings, and it's become a wonderful way to relax after a busy day."

    question: "Do you think traditional skills are important in today's world?",
    followUpQuestions: [
      "Which traditional skills might be lost in the future?",
      "How can schools help to preserve traditional skills?",
      "Do you think technology has made learning skills easier or more difficult?"
    ],
    sampleAnswer: "Yes, I believe traditional skills are still quite relevant and important in today's world, despite our increasing reliance on technology. Traditional skills often represent cultural heritage and connect us to our history. Many of these skills, like cooking traditional dishes, storytelling, or certain crafts also contribute to cultural identity and diversity, which enriches our global society."
